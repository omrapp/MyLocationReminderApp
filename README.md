# Location Reminder

## About Location Reminder App

Location Reminder App collects the user's location at a configurable interval and notifies the user if they haven't moved for a specified period. The app runs location tracking both in the foreground and background.

Key behaviors:
- Periodic location sampling (interval is configurable in the app settings).
- If the user remains within a small distance threshold (i.e., hasn't moved) after the configured interval, the app sends a local notification to remind the user.
- Background and Foreground tracking uses a background geolocation service for reliable updates once the app is on background and foreground.

Permissions and platform notes:
- Android: ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION are required for background tracking. You must also request runtime permissions.
- iOS: NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription and NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription keys are required in Info.plist. For background updates, request the appropriate authorization and configure background modes.

Security & privacy:
- Location data stays on the device. If you plan to sync or upload locations, make sure you inform users and secure the transport and storage appropriately.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
